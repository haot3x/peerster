# Peerster

Peerster is my implementation of the course project from [CPSC526 Building Decentralized System, Yale University](http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs426/2012/sched). The course is interesting and I really have fun in the class although the project does not cover all the stuff about decentralized systems. It currently supports the following features:

- Gossip Messaging
- Point-to-Point Messaging
- Search and File Sharing
- Onion Routing (in `finalProject/`)

I will extend the Peerster gradually in the future.
